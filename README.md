# AI Homework Assignment: Search Algorithms

## Introduction
This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence course at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). The goal is to familiarize students with various search algorithms, both classical and non-classical, and to demonstrate how these algorithms can be formulated to solve different problems using a uniform interface.

## Project Description
I had to implement a set of search algorithms and use them to solve multiple problems. The algorithms should have been implemented in such a way that they can solve different search problems independently of each other, without requiring any modifications to the algorithm implementations.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms need to be implemented:
- Simulated Annealing
- Hill Climbing (Simple, Random, First Choice, Random Restart)
- Genetic Algorithm

### Expected Outputs for Each Algorithm:
- Number of nodes created
- Number of nodes expanded
- Solution path and its cost (if applicable)

## Problems
You should define a separate class for each problem, including functions for the initial state, goal state (if applicable), and neighbors. The performance of the algorithms should be analyzed and compared for each problem.

### Problem 1: Graph Coloring
Implement different versions of the hill climbing algorithm for the graph coloring problem. Define a goal function for this problem and use it to analyze the performance of the algorithms.

### Problem 2: Word Table
Solve a word table problem using the Simulated Annealing algorithm. The input includes an array of words and a 2D array of letters. You need to find the maximum number of words from the dictionary that can be formed by rearranging the letters in the table.

### Problem 3: Keyboard Layout
Design a keyboard layout for English letters, optimizing for ease of use based on certain criteria (e.g., balance between left and right hand usage, common letter pairs). Solve this problem using the Genetic Algorithm.
